# Canadian Federal Election Data

There are lots of people who want to use Canadian Federal elections data, but no good source for it.  
Sure, Elections Canada and the Open Government Portal have the data, but it's hard to find, and 
harder still to clean and put into a usable state.  This project aims to change that.
